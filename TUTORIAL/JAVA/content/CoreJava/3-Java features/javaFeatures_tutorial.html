	<p>There is given many features of java. They are also known as java buzzwords. The Java Features given below are simple and easy to understand. </p>
	<h4>Simple</h4>
	<p><b>According to SunMicroSystems, Java language is simple:</b> because syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++). </p>
	<p>removed many confusing and/or rarely-used features e.g., explicit pointers, operator overloading etc.</p>
	<p>  No need to remove unreferenced objects because there is Automatic Garbage Collection in java.</p>
	
	<h4>Object Oriented</h4>
	<p>Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporates both data and behaviour.</p>
	<h4>Platform Independent</h4>
	<p>A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs. There are two types of platforms software-based and hardware-based. Java provides software-based platform. The Java platform differs from most other platforms in the sense that it's a software-based platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms</p>

	<h4>Secure</h4>
	<p>With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.</p>
	<h4>Robust</h4>
	<p>Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.</p>
	<h4>Architectural-neutral:</h4>
	<p>Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format which makes the compiled code to be executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.</p>
	<h4>Portable </h4>
	<p>We may carry the java bytecode to any platform.	</p>
	<h4>High-performance </h4>
	<p>Java is faster than traditional interpretation since byte code is "close" to native code still somewhat slower than a compiled language (e.g., C++)</p>
	<h4>Multi-threaded </h4>
	<p> A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it shares the same memory. Threads are important for multi-media, Web applications etc.</p>
	<h4>Distributed </h4>
	<p> We can create distributed applications in java. RMI and EJB are used for creating distributed applications. We may access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet.</p>

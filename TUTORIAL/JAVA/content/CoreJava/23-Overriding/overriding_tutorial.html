	<h4> What is override ? </h4>
	<p> Use one's authority to do the things in different way. </p>
	<p> In any object-oriented programming language, Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. </p>
	
	<h4> How to override a method </h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The ability of a subclass to override a method allows a class to inherit from a superclass whose behavior is "close enough" and then to modify behavior as needed. </li>
		<li>The overriding method has the same name, number and type of parameters, and return type as the method it overrides.</li>
		<li>An overriding method can also return a subtype of the type returned by the overridden method. This is called a covariant return type.</li>
		<li> When overriding a method, you might want to use the @Override annotation that instructs the compiler that you intend to override a method in the superclass. If, for some reason, the compiler detects that the method does not exist in one of the superclasses, it will generate an error.</li>
	</ul>	
	
	<h5> Sample example of method overriding. </h5>	
	@CODE_START@@JAVA@
	public class Animal {

		public void sleep() {
			System.out.println("An animal sleeps...");
		}
		
	}
	
	public class Bird extends Animal {
		
		@Override
		public void sleep() {
			System.out.println("A bird sleeps...");
		}
	}
	
	public class AppMain {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Animal animal = new Animal();
			Bird bird = new Bird();
			
			animal.sleep();			
			bird.sleep();
			
			//super class reference and subclass object.
			Animal animalRefBirdObj = new Bird(); 
			
			// when we call override method it will call only subclass method.
			animalRefBirdObj.sleep(); 
		}
	}
	@CODE_END@
	
	<div class="output-panel"> 
	<p> An animal sleeps...</p>
	<p> A bird sleeps...</p>
	<p> A bird sleeps...</p>
</div>	


	<h4>Advantages method overriding :</h4>
	<p>Method Overriding is used to provide specific implementation
		of a method that is already provided by its super class.</p>
	<p>Method Overriding is used for Runtime Polymorphism</p>
	<h4>Rules for method overriding :</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The argument list should be exactly the same as that of
			the overridden method.</li>
		<li>The return type should be the same or a subtype of the
			return type declared in the original overridden method in the
			super class.</li>
		<li>The access level cannot be more restrictive than the
			overridden method's access level. For example: if the super class
			method is declared public then the overridding method in the sub
			class cannot be either private or public. However the access
			level can be less restrictive than the overridden method's access
			level.</li>
		<li>Instance methods can be overridden only if they are
			inherited by the subclass.</li>
		<li>A method declared final cannot be overridden.</li>
		<li>A method declared static cannot be overridden but can be
			re-declared.</li>
		<li>If a method cannot be inherited then it cannot be
			overridden.</li>
		<li>A subclass within the same package as the instance's
			superclass can override any superclass method that is not
			declared private or final.</li>
		<li>A subclass in a different package can only override the
			non-final methods declared public or protected.</li>
		<li>An overriding method can throw any uncheck exceptions,
			regardless of whether the overridden method throws exceptions or
			not. However the overriding method should not throw checked
			exceptions that are new or broader than the ones declared by the
			overridden method. The overriding method can throw narrower or
			fewer exceptions than the overridden method.</li>
		<li>Constructors cannot be overridden.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Modifiers :</h4>
	<p>The access specifier for an overriding method can allow
		more, but not less, access than the overridden method. For
		example, a protected instance method in the superclass can be made
		public, but not private, in the subclass.</p>
	<p>You will get a compile-time error if you attempt to change
		an instance method in the superclass to a class method in the
		subclass, and vice versa.</p>
	<h4>Summary :</h4>
	<p>The following table summarizes what happens when you define
		a method with the same signature as a method in a superclass.</p>
	<h4>Defining a Method with the Same Signature as a
		Superclass's Method</h4>
	<table class="pc-table">
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>Superclass Instance Method</td>
			<td>Superclass Static Method</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Subclass Instance Method</td>
			<td>Overrides</td>
			<td>Generates a compile-time error</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Subclass Static Method</td>
			<td>Generates a compile-time error</td>
			<td>Hides</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>
		<b>Note :</b>In a subclass, you can overload the methods inherited
		from the superclass. Such overloaded methods neither hide nor
		override the superclass methodsâ€”they are new methods, unique to
		the subclass.
	</p>
	<h4>Difference between method Overloading and Method
		Overriding :</h4>
	<p>There are three basic differences between the method
		overloading and method overriding. They are as follows:</p>
	<table class="pc-table">
		<tr>
			<td>Method Overloading</td>
			<td>Method Overriding</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Method overloading is used to increase the readability
				of the program.</td>
			<td>Method overriding is used to provide the specific
				implementation of the method that is already provided by its
				super class.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Method overlaoding is performed within a class.</td>
			<td>Method overriding occurs in two classes that have IS-A
				relationship.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>In case of method overloading parameter must be
				different.</td>
			<td>In case of method overriding parameter must be same.</td>
		</tr>

<h4>Class Methods :</h4>
	<p>If a subclass defines a class method with the same signature
		as a class method in the superclass, the method in the subclass
		hides the one in the superclass.</p>
	<p>The distinction between hiding and overriding has important
		implications. The version of the overridden method that gets
		invoked is the one in the subclass. The version of the hidden
		method that gets invoked depends on whether it is invoked from the
		superclass or the subclass. Let's look at an example that contains
		two classes. The first is Animal, which contains one instance
		method and one class method:</p>

	<h5>Simple example on instance method</h5>

	@CODE_START@@JAVA@ public class Animal { public static void
	testClassMethod() { System.out.println("The Class" + "method in
	animal."); } public void testInstanceMethod() {
	System.out.println("The instance" + "method in animal."); } }
	@CODE_END@
	<p>The second class, a subclass of Animal, is called Cat:</p>

	<h5>Simple Example on Instance Method</h5>

	@CODE_START@@JAVA@ public class Cat extends Animal { public static
	void testClassMethod() { System.out.println("The class" + "method
	in Cat."); } public void testInstanceMethod() {
	System.out.println("The instance" + "method in Cat."); } public
	static void main(String[] args) { Cat myCat = new Cat(); Animal
	myAnimal = new Animal(); Animal.testClassMethod();
	myAnimal.testInstanceMethod(); } } @CODE_END@

	<div class="output-panel">
		<p>The Classmethod in animal.</p>
		<p>The instancemethod in animal.</p>
	</div>
	<p>The Cat class overrides the instance method in Animal and
		hides the class method in Animal. The mainmethod in this class
		creates an instance of Cat and calls testClassMethod() on the
		class and testInstanceMethod() on the instance.</p>
	<p>As promised, the version of the hidden method that gets
		invoked is the one in the superclass, and the version of the
		overridden method that gets invoked is the one in the subclass.</p>

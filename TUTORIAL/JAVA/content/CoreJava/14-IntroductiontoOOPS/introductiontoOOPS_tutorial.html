<h4>Object Oriented Programming in Java</h4>
	
<p>Java is known as an Object Oriented language. So, what does Object Oriented mean? It means that the foundations of any kind of program constructed in Java might be imagined in terms of Objects. A good example of this idea should be to have a look at a handful of sample business requirements for a product. Imagine that we are tasked with constructing a software program intended to keep track of an actual public library system. This system must keep track of each of the branches associated with the libraries, the whole set of materials that can be contained in the branches, and additionally all of the people that may need to access books from the library&rsquo;s branch.</p>
	
<p>The first thing we&rsquo;re able to do is examine those specs and pinpoint all of the keywords which happen to be nouns. For the record, a noun is actually a person, place or thing. Which means, if we analyze our requirements we discern these particular nouns:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Library</li>	
	<li>Book</li>
	<li>Branch</li>
	<li>Customer</li>
</ul>

<p> All these words represent Objects in Java. This really is, in essence, Object Oriented programming (generally known as O-O programming). What we can now go about doing, is in fact arrange these four Objects on to some sort of piece of paper, and begin to distinguish what sort of attributes each one of these Objects contains. What do I mean by the attributes? Well, in O-O development this is known as identifying the “has a” relationships. To provide an example, aBranch “has an” address, a Book “has a” title, a Customer “has a” name. We will map out the most important important attributes that each one of these Objects contain, and build ourselves a terrific starting point for the design of our Java application.</p>
		 
<p>Object Oriented development allows developers to think in terms of real life &rdquo;things&rdquo; or Objects, and simply solve issues with all those Objects. It&rsquo;s important to remember that Java is actually not the only O-O programming language in existence, as it was initially started nearly five decades ago and plenty of modern programming languages utilize Object Oriented principles. Some of these languages include C++, C#, Objective-C, Python, Ruby, and Visual Basic.</p>				 
		 
		 
<h4>Object-oriented programming (OOP) languages are designed to overcome these problems.</h4>

<ul>
	<li>The basic unit of OOP is a class, which encapsulates both the static properties and dynamic operations within a &rdquo;box&rdquo;, and specifies the public interface for using these boxes. Since classes are well-encapsulated, it is easier to reuse these classes. In other words, OOP combines the data structures and algorithms of a software entity inside the same box.</li>

	<li>OOP languages permit higher level of abstraction for solving real-life problems. The traditional procedural language (such as C and Pascal) forces you to think in terms of the structure of the computer (e.g. memory bits and bytes, array, decision, loop) rather than thinking in terms of the problem you are trying to solve. The OOP languages (such as Java, C++ and C#) let you think in the problem space, and use software objects to represent and abstract entities of the problem space to solve the problem.</li>		
</ul>
	
	
<h4>Benefits of OOP</h4>	

<p>The procedural-oriented languages focus on procedures, with function as the basic unit. You need to first figure out all the functions and then think about how to represent data.</p>
	
<p>The object-oriented languages focus on components that the user perceives, with objects as the basic unit. You figure out all the objects by putting all the data and operations that describe the user&rsquo;s interaction with the data.</p>			

<p><b>Object-Oriented technology has many benefits:</b></p>

<p>Ease in software design as you could think in the problem space rather than the machine&rsquo;s bits and bytes. You are dealing with high-level concepts and abstractions. Ease in design leads to more productive software development.</p>

<p>Ease in software maintenance: object-oriented software are easier to understand, therefore easier to test, debug, and maintain.</p>

<p>Reusable software: you don&rsquo;t need to keep re-inventing the wheels and re-write the same functions for different situations. The fastest and safest way of developing a new application is to reuse existing codes - fully tested and proven codes.</p>

<p>Java is an Object Oriented Language. As a language that has the Object Oriented feature Java supports the following fundamental concepts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Polymorphism</li>
	<li>Inheritance</li>
	<li>Encapsulation</li>
	<li>Abstraction</li>
	<li>Classes</li>
	<li>Objects</li>
	<li>Instance</li>
	<li>Method</li>
	<li>Message Parsing</li>
</ul>


<h4>What is difference between object-oriented programming language and object-based programming language?</h4>

<p>Object based programming language follows all the features of OOPs except Inheritance. JavaScript and VBScript are examples of object based programming languages.</p>

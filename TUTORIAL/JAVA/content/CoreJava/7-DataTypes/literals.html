<h4>Java Literals</h4>	
	<p>A literal is a source code representation of a fixed value. They are represented directly in the code without any computation.</p>
	
	<h4>Syntax</h4>

@CODE_START@@JAVA@
boolean result = false;
char gender = 'M';
short s = 10000;
int i = -1256;

	<p>In the preceding statements, the right hand side values are called literals because these values are being stored into the variables shown at the left hand side. As the data type of the variable changes, the type of the literal also changes. So we have different types of literals.They are :</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Integer literals</li>
		<li>Float literals</li>
		<li>Character literals</li>
		<li>String literals</li>
		<li>Boolean literals</li>
	</ul>

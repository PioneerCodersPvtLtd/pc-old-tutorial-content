	/*
	 * CriteriaApi introduced mainly to operate on database where logical operations are required to get data  
	 * 
	 * Hibernate provides alternate ways of manipulating objects and in turn data available in RDBMS tables. 
	 * One of the methods is Criteria API which allows you to build up a criteria query object programmatically where you can apply filtration rules and logical conditions(gt,lt,eq)
	 * 
	 * 
	 * The Criteria interface provides methods to apply criteria such as retreiving all the records of table whose salary is greater than 50000 etc.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * We can retrieve data from database in hibernate they provided several efficient techniques 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 1.HQL(if we want operate queries independent of database we will use HQL)
	 * 2.Criteria Api (if largest amount of data is present in database we want to apply logical operations   like (lessthan,greaterthan ,equal ) to suppress data we will use Criteria Api 
	 * 3.Native Sql (if we have strong knowledge on sql and we want apply db operations directly on database we will use Native Sql ,but in this approach db to db query may change 
	 *

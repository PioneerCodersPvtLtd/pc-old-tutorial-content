<p>	
The main distinguishing characteristic of a value type is the fact that they do not define their own lifecycle.An object of value type has no database identity, it belongs to an entity instance and its persistent state is embedded in the table row of the owning entity. Value types don't have identifiers or identifier properties  We say that they are "owned" by something else which defines their lifecycle. Value types are further classified into 3 sub-categories:<br>
1.Basic types<br>
2.Composite types<br>
3.Collection types.<br> 
<h3>Basic value Types</h3>
The norm for basic value types is that they map a single database value (column) to a single, non-aggregated Java type. Hibernate provides a number of built-in basic types, which we will present in the following sections by the Java type. Mainly these follow the natural mappings recommended in the JDBC specification.<br>
